<h1>"About Me"</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Kayla. I'm currently 25 years year and I currently work in IT!
<br>I enjoy going out and hanging out with friends! <br/> 
I love to listen to music, go to the movies to watch the newest cinema, and go to concerts!</p>
 <h2>"My Hobbies"</h2>
 <p>One of my favorite hobbies are video games! 
    I remember my first gaming system was a leap frog in my youth. Then when I was slighty older I received a  pink gameboy advanced and that's when my love of gaming first occured!
    Pokemon was my favorite game growing up! I used to try to save any money that I was able to try to buy the newest version of Pokemon. I became engrossed in trying to capture the strongest pokemon I could capture or the cutest one like evee.
    On the week days growing up, I would try to watch all the newest episodes of pokemone to watch Ash Ketchum journry to become the best trainer along with pikachu. 
    One game that currently has me in a hook is Baldurs gate 3.
    BG3 is based off of DND 5th edition, with this game you can create your own story however you like.
    You can be a human fighter folk hero, a traveling elf bard, or a dwarf druid.
    You can either defeat the forces of a cult that wishes to take over the land or take the power yourself and rule with an iron fist.</p>
